# Quest-Schedule
 Allows for visualization of the quest schedule in the web browser with filtering by age and day of week.

Best case is we are allowed to use javascript and everything just works, with the schedule changes being typed into the one file that holds the classes and the rest auto-generating without intervention.

Worst case is I need to split the day's graphs vertically and load pure html into squarespace, re-generating and re-uploading any time there is an update to the schedule. This worst case also completely prevents us from using the search by age function unless I can pull off something very very funky that squarespace likely completely prevents.
